            i came across a reel yesterday. guess its in fashion to not complete sentences nowadays. im doin the same duh. <br>
            there's so many different ways in which you can love somebody and actually never know about it unless you go into no contact for over ten months. its hilarious at this point.
            <i>"never was much of a romantic"</i>, and still continues to include me as a film character he created on my existence.

            i have no idea there's something about this fucking song which makes me believe ive known it my entire life and now's the time for me to jump off a building into the waters.
            its happy, relating to taylor. but when it comes down to del rey, you gave me no choice. ive always wondered about that one scene from <b>gossip girl <i>season 4 episode 22</i></b> where 
            she goes back to Louis. and she confesses she'll love Chuck forever. aren't we all like that at the end of the day, though. dont we all have that one person. we know. i know too. he does too.

            i have no idea. there has been so much of clarity in the show between what is desired and what is right. they were'nt right.
            but when will i actually know what's right. wouldn't i only have control over what is desired. <br>
